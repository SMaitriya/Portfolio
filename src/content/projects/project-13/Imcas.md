## Overview

During my apprenticeship at **IMCAS** — an international organization specializing in medical and cosmetic surgery congresses — I worked as a **Front-End Developer** on the redesign of their main web platform.

My main mission was to **translate Figma designs into a responsive, maintainable front-end**, using **Laravel Blade templates** and **TailwindCSS**. I collaborated closely with designers, back-end developers, and the product team to ensure **pixel-perfect design**, **consistency across pages**, and **mobile-friendly layouts**.

## Key Contributions

- Converted **Figma mockups into reusable Blade components** for buttons, banners, info panels, and other UI elements
- Built **responsive layouts** compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Structured dynamic content with **Blade loops and conditionals**
- Integrated back-end data into the front-end views
- Applied **TailwindCSS** utility classes for spacing, typography, and color consistency
- Participated in **UI review and iteration cycles** with the design and product teams to refine components and page layouts
- Documented code and added comments to ensure maintainability and clarity

## Pages and Sections I Developed

Below are some of the pages I worked on fully or contributed significantly to:

- **<a href="https://www.imcas.com/en/worldwide-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldwide Events</a>** – Developed responsive sections listing global congresses, using Blade loops for dynamic event cards.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Laravel Blade** (templating system)  
- **TailwindCSS** (utility-first CSS framework)  
- **JavaScript (ES6 / jQuery)** for interactive UI components  
- **Figma** (design reference and collaboration)  
- **Git / GitHub Desktop** (version control and team collaboration)  

---

## Outcome

The front-end components I created were **fully integrated into the production platform** and became part of IMCAS’s **design system**. My work improved:

- **Layout consistency** across pages and platforms  
- **Mobile usability** and responsive behavior  
- **Development efficiency** through reusable templates and components  

This apprenticeship strengthened my expertise in **Laravel Blade**, **TailwindCSS**, and **front-end integration**, and gave me hands-on experience delivering real-world UI in a production environment.
