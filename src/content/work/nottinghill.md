I worked in a nightclub at the heart of the city. This experience allowed me to dive into the vibrant nightlife of the British capital and develop valuable skills in event management, communication, and problem-solving in high-energy situations. It also provided me with an enriching immersion into London's social and professional culture, further strengthening my ability to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments.
