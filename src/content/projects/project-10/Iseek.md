## Project Overview

Iseek is a mobile application built with React Native that allows users to search for artists or music tracks via the iTunes API. Users can browse search results, select their favorite items, and save them to a personal collection. The app features a two-tab navigation system: **ISeek** for searching, and **Collection** for viewing and managing saved items. The collection is persisted locally using Redux and AsyncStorage.
