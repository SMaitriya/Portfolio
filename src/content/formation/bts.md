I completed my Associate Degree in Computer Science in one year (BTS SLAM). This was an enriching and intense program. Thanks to GRETA, I was able to finish the standard two-year curriculum in a single year. This opportunity required great motivation and strong passion, qualities I was able to demonstrate, as evidenced by my 16.5 average in the first semester.
