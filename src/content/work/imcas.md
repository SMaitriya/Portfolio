During this internship I collaborated closely with UX designers, translating Figma designs into functional code.

I worked in an international company that organizes congresses worldwide. My main task was to rebuild their website, making it more modern, user-friendly, and responsive.

This experience strengthened both my technical and communication skills, as I had to coordinate with different professionals to ensure the website met all requirements.
