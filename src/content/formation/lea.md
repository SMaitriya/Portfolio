Thanks to my three years of studies in Applied Foreign Languages (LEA), along with a semester exchange at Renmin University in China, I was able to acquire a deep understanding of two languages as well as their history. These experiences also allowed me to develop strong skills in economics, management, and law, particularly in terms of comprehension and analysis. Moreover, during my semester in Suzhou at Renmin University, I had the opportunity to attend courses with French master's students as well as Chinese students, which provided me with a valuable intercultural experience.
