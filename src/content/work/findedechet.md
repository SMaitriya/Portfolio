During my second internship as part of my French Technical Degree in Computer Science (BTS), I had the opportunity to work on creating a B2B marketplace for a company focused on sustainable development in the film, short film, and television industry. The goal was to facilitate the sharing of items, such as furniture, in order to reduce overconsumption and waste.

This internship allowed me to develop my skills in autonomy and explore new technologies, particularly JavaScript with the React framework. I was able to take charge of the project independently and gain new knowledge on my own.

The experience also gave me a deeper understanding of the challenges related to sustainable development in the audiovisual sector, and I was able to contribute to the implementation of innovative solutions to promote more responsible consumption.

- Mocking up the plan for a B2B Marketplace project.
- Backend development in Laravel and frontend in React.
- Mastery of GitHub for version control.
- Complete independent creation of the project, including design, development, and functional testing.
