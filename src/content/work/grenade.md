My first internship (French Technical Degree in Computer Science - BTS) took place within an association, where I had the opportunity to learn and develop skills in WordPress. This internship allowed me to understand the processes involved in uploading content on the platform. I gained valuable hands-on experience in creating and managing websites, which enhanced my technical skills and expertise in web development.
