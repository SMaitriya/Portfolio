To better prepare for my internship project, which involved creating a marketplace using Laravel, I decided to follow a tutorial from Laravel's documentation. This tutorial guided me in building a web application that allows users to send, modify, or delete messages, similar to Twitter. <br>

- Sending a message with the account Toto: Toto sends a message and has the option to modify or delete it.

- Connection with the Tata account: Tata logs in and replies to Toto. Tata can only modify and delete their own message.

- Toto sends a message and has the option to edit or delete it: Here is the code for the index view in REACT that allows sending a message
