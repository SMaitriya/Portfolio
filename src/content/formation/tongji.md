For two years, I had the opportunity to study Mandarin in Shanghai. This experience was much more than just language learning. Living abroad from a young age allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and explore the country and its culture in an authentic way.

Learning the language and discovering Chinese culture on-site was a transformative experience for me. It not only enabled me to learn a new language but also gave me a deep understanding of the diversity and cultural richness of China. This full immersion taught me to adapt to different multicultural situations and interact effectively in an international environment.
